    <img src="../images/zucchini-with-egg.jpeg">
    <p>This is a dish my grandparents used to make. It is so simple, yet it is so yummy! It is great in the summer and even better with homegrown zucchini.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 large zucchini, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water, or as desired</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute zucchini until tender, about 10 minutes. Season zucchini with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs with a fork in a bowl; add water and beat until evenly combined. Pour eggs over zucchini; cook and stir until eggs are scrambled and no longer runny, about 5 minutes. Season zucchini and eggs with salt and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
